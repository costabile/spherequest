# Introduction #

A base file for starting SphereQuest


# Details #

This is the base file for our Game. The revision note states this but I'll rewrite it here. On my computer I must use #include <glut.h> although on Windows Vista, I used #include <GL\glut.h>. If you get an error, I would recommend placing glut.h in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\include\ directory and glut32.lib in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\lib directory. I'm really sorry if this is any inconvenience to any one but it seems to be the only way I could get the file to work.

Cheers!
