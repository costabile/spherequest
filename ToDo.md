# Introduction #
I thought it would be useful to keep a list of incomplete tasks so that if you don't know what to do next, you can check here.  Also, this way we won't forget any ideas.  So if you think of anything, add it to the list.  If you complete anything, take it off the list.


# Details #
In no particular order:
  * --Done-- Collision detection (primarily with walls, but possibly with wise men, map boundaries, and end-of-level items)
  * --Done-- Organize file structure!  Make classes.  Separate some stuff into different cpp files.
  * --Done-- Make smoother sphere motion.  i.e. Tapping a key should give the sphere a bit of momentum rather than translating it a static distance forward.
  * --Done-- Animation!
  * Improve lighting (also for deliverable on Monday, but what we have now is passable, if worse comes to worse)
  * --Done-- Camera collisions.  Don't let the camera go into walls. (This could also potentially be fixed with backface culling)
  * Something with the Zen counter.  Zen goes down when you hit an obstacle, or fail a puzzle?  Ben suggested that the sphere should glow, and grows dimmer as Zen goes down.
  * Other levels. Duh.
  * $Ben$ Make level 1 somewhat more complex/add puzzles or some kind of challenges.
  * Ticker tape thingy along the bottom?
  * Audio
  * --Done-- Beautification.  Make scenery look more interesting?  Add textures to walls, maybe temples.  Also get the texture on the skybox to stay still.
  * Save and load state?
  * --Done-- $Kaitlin$ Read maps from files - this would make it more modular and would make it easier to have maps of varying size
  * $Kaitlin$ Read any map of any size, rather than just the first level...
  * Some kind of menu
  * One of the project requirements is that when you finish, you're asked if you'd like to play again...may as well add this.
